  <h1>eBook Clipper 0.9</h1>
  <p>Thank you for trying this extension.</p>
  <p>This is an early version of the extension and the user experience is
     still rough. Hopefully it will still be useful to you.
  </p>
  <h2>How to Use</h2>
  <ol>
  <li>Open the sidebar.</li>
  <li>Enter the ID of the element whose content you want to clip in the input
      labelled 'Element ID'. Typically you'll have to find out what the ID is
      using the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools">developer tools</a>.
      (This aspect should be improved in future versions of the extension.)</li>
  <li>Click the 'Clip' button. A new chapter should be added under the
     'Chapters' heading.</li>
  <li>Optionally, enter a title for your ebook in the input labelled 'Title ID'.</li>
  <li>Click the 'Save eBook' button and download the epub file.</li>
  </ol>
