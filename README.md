# Web Clipper
This is an web extension for Firefox which allows users to create ebooks from
page clippings.

# Building
This project uses `npm` for developer dependencies only. External libraries
are included in the source under `src/lib`.

There is no transpilation/building step apart from using `web-ext` to package
the extension.  There are `npm` scripts for linting and formatting.
